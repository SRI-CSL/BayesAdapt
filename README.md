BayesAdapt uses uv to manage requirements. Start by installing uv as described by the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).

Clone the code by running: ```git clone https://github.com/SRI-CSL/BayesAdapt.git```

Inside the ```BayesAdapt``` directory run ```uv init``` to build the environment.

Then run ```source .venv/bin/activate``` to load the environment.

To use wandb, make sure the environment variable ```WANDB_ENTITY``` is set to your full wandb username.
